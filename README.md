The "Die Roller" Android app is a handy tool that emulates the experience of rolling a physical die. With a simple interface featuring a die and a "Roll Die" button, this app generates a random number each time the button is clicked, mimicking the unpredictability of a traditional die roll.
I am sharing the screenshot of App here.
